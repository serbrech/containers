# A Lap Around Containers

We start by explaining the concepts behind containers. 
We present their backbone, how we got to where we are, and who is supporting this initiative.
Then, we take a quick look at the Open Container Initiative, before showing what we can do with Docker and the tools provided around it.

By demoing the tools around docker in a natural progression,
We give an idea of how they plug into eachother to provide a powerful way of envisionning software.

Build, package, deployment, distribution, isolation. Containers are revolutionizing how we make software.
It's already spreading in the unix world, and it is about to change everything you know on WIndows.`
